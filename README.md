# KalmarGen
KalmarGen is a generative system that improves the creative controllability and usability of neural image generation and image editing, and its adaptability to diverse creative workflows. 

It has a unified system and interface for multiple generative tasks and modalities, and new and improved forms of guidance for the generation process. New/improved controllability features include e.g.:
- improved masked image editing, 
- improved text prompting, 
- and the addition of different reference image-based guidance options.

The KalmarGen system extends Stable Diffusion, and work is in progress for applying it to other generative methods too, including VQGAN-CLIP. The system and its interface were designed for efficiency, both in terms of limited hardware requirements and generation time and thus wide accessibility, and in terms of productivity.
